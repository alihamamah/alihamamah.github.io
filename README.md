# Welcome
Welcome to my page! I am a ```software engineer``` who kind of lost the overview of the current knowledge state. For this reason I document here my knowledge, skills, resources and projects. Maintaining this page helps me to stay disciplined and allows me to keep an eye on an overview of professional skills.

# How to navigate this page?
- Every part of the page is titled by the general purpose of a technologies (for example: version control). As sub-parts I will be listing related information and experience with the specific technology (for example: git).
- Projects are listed separately, where I document them and specify the usage of the different technologies.

# Version control
## git
In every single project of mine I use git to organise my work, even this repo is using git!
My main three commands are:
```
git add
git commit 
git push
```
- I check the history using 
```
git log
```
- I implement new features in separated branch created by
```
git branch <name_of_the_feature_OR_ticket_number>
```
- In order to avoid merge conflicts on develop branch, I learnt to merge the develop branch first into the feature branch, solve any potential merge conflicts and then create the pull request into develop.
- If I have questions, I always try to read the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) first.
